# Spoken

A pocket reader that pulls clean text from any page. Built with Expo, Expo Router, and NativeWind.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## What’s inside

- In-app browser with address/search bar
- One-tap text extraction from the active page
- Reader sheet for clean, distraction-free text

## Notes

- Text extraction uses the page DOM (`article`, `main`, or `body`).
- Try public pages without paywalls for best results.
